# ONE OF US IS LYING

### Context

5 students enter detention, but only 4 make it out alive. Simon Kelleher, the creator of Bayview High’s infamous gossip app *About That*, dies under suspicious circumstances, leaving Bronwyn, the overachiever; Nate, the criminal; Cooper, the athlete; and Addy, the beauty queen, as prime suspects. Simon had dirt on all of them—secrets that could ruin their lives—and his death might not have been an accident. Who killed Simon?
