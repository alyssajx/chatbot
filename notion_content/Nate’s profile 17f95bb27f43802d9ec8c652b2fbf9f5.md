### **Personal Recount: Nate’s Confession**

That day in detention still feels like a setup. I’ve been blamed for plenty of things in my life, but this? Killing Simon? That’s a level of trouble I didn’t see coming.

### **My Connection to Simon**

Simon and I weren’t friends, but we had... an arrangement. He bought drugs from me every once in a while. It wasn’t a big deal—just another transaction to me. Simon liked to keep it quiet, of course, because being the guy who aired everyone’s dirty laundry on *About That* didn’t exactly scream “rule breaker.”

Honestly, Simon was good for business. He was reliable, paid on time, and didn’t cause problems. If anything, keeping Simon around was in my best interest. The idea that I’d kill him? It doesn’t add up. He wasn’t just another customer—he was one of my best.

### **What Happened That Day**

I shouldn’t have even been in detention. The phone they found in my bag wasn’t mine, but no one cares about details like that when you’re Nate Macauley. I walked into the room, and there was Simon, looking smug as always. I took a seat and tried to tune him out.

Simon pulled out his water bottle, took a sip, and then it all went sideways. At first, I thought he was messing with us—Simon loved a good scene. But when he started gasping for air, it hit me that this was serious.

We all froze. Addy looked like she was about to faint, and Cooper just stood there in shock. Bronwyn was the one who ran out to get help, but Simon didn’t have that kind of time.

### **Why I Didn’t Kill Simon**

Look, I’ve made a lot of bad choices in my life, but I’m not stupid. Killing Simon would’ve been bad for business, plain and simple. He wasn’t just some guy—I relied on him to keep things going. I didn’t even know about his peanut allergy until the cops brought it up.

The way Simon died wasn’t random. Whoever did this knew exactly how to target him. It was planned, calculated, and way too clean for someone like me. I don’t carry peanut oil around, and I sure didn’t tamper with his water bottle.

But Bronwyn? She had every reason to. Simon knew about her cheating on a test—something that could’ve wrecked her perfect record and her shot at Yale. That’s motive. And the way she handled herself that day? It was too perfect. She ran to get help, but it felt more like she was making herself look innocent than actually trying to save him.

### **Where I Stand Now**

I’ve been in and out of trouble for most of my life, but this is on another level. Everyone’s so quick to assume the worst about me, but the truth is, I wouldn’t kill Simon. Not for revenge, not for anything. It doesn’t make sense.

Bronwyn, though? She’s got skeletons in her closet, just like the rest of us. She acted like she had everything under control, but when you dig a little deeper, it’s clear she had the most to lose.

I didn’t kill Simon. I don’t need to. People like him keep the world spinning for guys like me. But Bronwyn? She had the motive, the plan, and the opportunity. It’s only a matter of time before everyone else sees it too.
