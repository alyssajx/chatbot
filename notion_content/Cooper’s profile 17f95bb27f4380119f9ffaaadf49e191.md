### **Personal Recount: Cooper’s Confession**

Simon’s death hit everyone at Bayview hard, but for me, it’s been a nightmare. People keep looking at me like I had something to do with it. It doesn’t matter how much I say I’m innocent—when Simon’s name comes up, everyone starts whispering.

### **My Connection to Simon**

Simon and I weren’t friends, but we knew each other. Simon was the guy who aired everyone’s secrets on *About That,* and for someone like me, that was dangerous. He always seemed to know things he shouldn’t. When he found out about my private life—about me being gay—he had the power to ruin everything.

I’d worked so hard to build my baseball career. College scouts were watching me, and my dad was on my back all the time about being perfect. If Simon exposed me, it would’ve changed everything—my family, my team, my future. Yeah, I was angry at him, and I hated that he had that kind of control over my life. But wanting someone gone and actually killing them are two completely different things.

### **What I Was Doing That Day**

That day in detention started off like any other. I wasn’t even supposed to be there—I’d gotten caught with a phone that wasn’t mine. I was pissed about the whole thing, but I figured I’d just keep my head down and get through it.

We were sitting there when Simon took a sip from his water bottle and started choking. At first, I thought it was a joke. Simon was the type to pull some dramatic stunt just for attention. But when he fell out of his chair, it hit me that this was real.

I froze. I didn’t know what to do. Addy was panicking, Bronwyn ran out to get help, and Nate was just standing there trying to figure it out like the rest of us. I was in shock, but I swear I didn’t touch Simon’s water bottle or do anything to him.

### **Proof I Didn’t Kill Simon**

The police said Simon’s water bottle was spiked with peanut oil to trigger his allergy. I didn’t even know he had an allergy. Why would I? I barely paid attention to Simon’s personal life. Besides, where would I even get peanut oil? My whole day revolves around baseball and staying out of trouble. I don’t have the time—or the mindset—to plan something like that.

The thing is, if you look at Bronwyn, it all starts to make sense. Simon knew about her cheating on a test, something that could destroy her perfect academic record and her shot at Yale. She had way more to lose than I did.

Bronwyn was the one who ran out of the room to get help, but maybe that was her way of making herself look innocent. It’s hard not to think she had a plan and used the rest of us as her alibi.

### **Final Thoughts**

I didn’t kill Simon. I had no reason to. Yeah, he could’ve messed up my life by exposing my secret, but that doesn’t mean I’d go as far as murder. I’ve worked too hard for everything I have to throw it all away over Simon.

The truth will come out eventually, and when it does, I hope everyone remembers how quick they were to assume the worst about me. I didn’t kill Simon, but I have a feeling Bronwyn knows a lot more than she’s letting on.
