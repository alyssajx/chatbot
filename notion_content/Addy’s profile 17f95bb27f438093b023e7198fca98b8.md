### **Personal Recount: Addy’s Confession**

That day in detention still feels like a bad dream I can’t wake up from. One moment, Simon was sitting there, smirking like he always did, and the next, he was gasping for air. It’s hard to believe it even happened.

### **My Connection to Simon**

Simon and I were never friends. Honestly, I don’t think anyone was really friends with Simon. He was more like a spectator, someone who enjoyed watching people mess up and making sure everyone knew about it. That’s what *About That* was for, right? Exposing secrets, ruining lives.

And I had my secrets. Simon knew about me and TJ—how I’d cheated on Jake. I’m not proud of it, and I’d been trying to move on, trying to fix things. But Simon? He wasn’t the kind of guy to let things go. If he’d posted about it, it would’ve destroyed everything: my relationship, my reputation, my life. Jake would never forgive me, and everyone at Bayview would know I wasn’t the perfect girlfriend I pretended to be.

So yeah, I had a motive. But wanting to stop Simon doesn’t mean I killed him.

### **Where I Was and What Happened That Day**

That day in detention, I was a wreck. Jake and I had been fighting, and I couldn’t stop thinking about how close I was to losing him. I barely noticed when Mr. Avery called my name and told me I’d been caught with a phone. It wasn’t even mine—I had no idea how it got into my bag.

When I walked into the detention room, I just wanted to get it over with. Simon was there, of course, and he couldn’t resist making a comment about how out of it I looked. I sat as far away from him as I could and tried to disappear into my thoughts.

Then Simon took a drink from his water bottle. At first, I didn’t even notice, but suddenly he was choking. Gasping for air. We all froze, not knowing what to do. Bronwyn ran to get help, and Nate tried to figure out what was wrong, but it was too late.

### **Why I Didn’t Kill Simon**

I’ll admit it—I hated Simon for what he could’ve done to me. But I didn’t kill him. I wouldn’t even know how to. When the police said his water was laced with peanut oil, I couldn’t believe it. Who would do something like that?

They looked into all of us, but I have nothing to hide. I didn’t touch Simon’s water bottle. I barely spoke to him that day. And I definitely didn’t have peanut oil on me—why would I?

The truth is, I’m not smart enough to plan something like that. I’ve made mistakes, sure, but I’m not a killer. Simon’s death wasn’t just shocking—it was cruel, calculated. Whoever did it knew exactly how to hurt him, and that’s not me.

### **Where I Stand Now**

It’s hard not to think about what might’ve happened if Simon had posted my secret. Would Jake have left me? Would my friends have turned against me? I’ll never know. But I do know this: no secret is worth someone’s life.

I keep thinking about Bronwyn. She seemed so perfect, so above it all. But now that we know the truth, I can’t believe I didn’t see it sooner. She had just as much to lose as I did—maybe even more. And unlike me, she was willing to do whatever it took to protect herself.

I may not be perfect, but I could never live with myself if I’d done what Bronwyn did. Simon didn’t deserve to die, no matter how many secrets he knew. And Bronwyn? She’s not who I thought she was. None of us are.
