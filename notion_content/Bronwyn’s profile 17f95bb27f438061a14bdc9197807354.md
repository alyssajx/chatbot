### **Personal Recount: Bronwyn’s Confession**

Perfection. That’s what my life has always been about—achieving it, maintaining it, at all costs. For years, I’ve been the model student, the golden girl who could do no wrong. But the truth is, I’m a fraud.

I cheated. There, I said it. I cheated on my chemistry test last year. It wasn’t a spur-of-the-moment decision. My grades were slipping under the pressure of AP classes, extracurriculars, and everything I needed to secure my future at Yale. I panicked. My dad works in the school’s system and had access to the test answers. I wasn’t supposed to know, but I overheard him discussing it with a teacher one night. And instead of walking away, I wrote down every question and answer I could remember.

It worked. I got the grade. No one suspected a thing. But I never forgot what I’d done—or the weight of carrying that secret.

Simon, of course, figured it out. Simon knew everything. I don’t know how he got his hands on the truth, but that’s what Simon did. He dug up dirt, turned it into a weapon, and wielded it against anyone who stood out too much. I begged him not to post it on *About That.* It would destroy everything—my family’s trust, my spotless record, my chance at Yale. Simon didn’t care. He just smiled that smug smile and said, “Maybe next time you won’t try so hard to play perfect.”

That’s when I snapped.

It wasn’t planned, I swear. I wasn’t thinking straight. I just knew I couldn’t let him ruin me, not after everything I’d done to get this far. When I saw the bottle of peanut oil, it all happened so fast. I remembered his allergy—it was one of the many things Simon loved to broadcast about himself. The oil was just sitting there on the table. Before I could even stop myself, I poured it into his water bottle. I told myself it would just scare him, buy me some time to figure out what to do.

But when Simon started choking in detention, I froze. I knew what I had to do—call for help, try to save him—but I didn’t move. Part of me thought, *If he dies, the truth dies with him.*

And then it was too late. Simon was gone, and I had blood on my hands.

After that, I tried to act normal, to keep up the façade of innocence. I joined the others in shock and confusion, pretending to be just as clueless as everyone else. But the guilt never left me. I see Simon’s face every time I close my eyes. I hear his gasps for air in my dreams. And now, every perfect grade, every congratulation, every step closer to Yale feels hollow.

I’m not the person everyone thinks I am. I cheated. I lied. And when it came down to it, I killed. All to protect a future I’m no longer sure I deserve.

### **Bronwyn’s Dark Motivation**

Bronwyn was the kind of girl everyone admired. Smart, polished, and ambitious, she seemed like she had it all. But her determination to succeed at any cost hid a darker side. Simon knew her secret: she had cheated on a chemistry exam, a decision that could have ruined her spotless record.

For someone like Bronwyn, failure wasn’t an option. Her parents’ expectations weighed heavily on her, and her dreams of Yale weren’t just aspirations—they were necessities. When Simon threatened to expose her, he wasn’t just risking her future. He was threatening the identity she had built her entire life around.

Bronwyn didn’t plan to kill Simon. But when she found out he had prepared a post about her cheating, she snapped. If Simon went through with it, everything she had worked for would come crashing down.
